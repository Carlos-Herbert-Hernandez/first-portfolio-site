# first-portfolio-site
Thanks to Traversy Media (Brad Traversy) for inspiring this!
I started this by following Brad's tutorial.
Then, using what I've learned about HTML/CSS, I customized it for my own portfolio site.
I could have used Bootstrap or some other framework, but I wanted to practice coding HTML faster.
As a bonus, I wanted to get better at git bash and emmett.

Thanks for viewing!
